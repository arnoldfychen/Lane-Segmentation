# Lane-Segmentation
Tensorflow version code for Lane-Segmentation-Solution-For-BaiduAI-Autonomous-Driving-Competition 

The original code of Lane-Segmentation-Solution-For-BaiduAI-Autonomous-Driving-Competition is here: 
https://github.com/gujingxiao/Lane-Segmentation-Solution-For-BaiduAI-Autonomous-Driving-Competition, 
it was implemented with paddlepaddle, I try to rewrite it with Tensorflow. 

Please note I still have no time to tune and verify this code till now, I'll commit a stable version when someday I have time to check and run training with it.
